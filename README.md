# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a study guide for the prework for the UT Coding Bootcamp. My motivation for creating this webpage was to have a study guide I could refer to with all the new information I am learning. I built this ptoject for the students in my cohort and myself to have a reference to the new knowlodge we are acruiring. It solves the problem of not having a guide to study material. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and how they work together to create webpages.
